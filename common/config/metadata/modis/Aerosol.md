# MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Aerosol Optical Depth

MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth (or Aerosol Optical Thickness) layer indicates the level at which particles in the air (aerosols) prevent light from traveling through the atmosphere. Aerosols absorb and scatter incoming sunlight, which reduces visibility and increases the optical depth. An optical depth of less than 0.1 indicates a clear sky with maximum visibility, and a value of 1 indicates the presence of aerosols so dense that people would have difficulty seeing the Sun. Aerosols have an effect on human health, weather and the climate. Sources of aerosols include pollution from factories, smoke from fires, dust from dust storms, sea salts, and volcanic ash and smog. Aerosols compromise human health when inhaled by people with asthma or other respiratory illnesses. Aerosols also have an affect on the weather and climate by cooling or warming the earth, helping or preventing clouds from forming.   

The MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth layer, using the Optical Depth Land And Ocean parameter, is available from both the Terra (MOD04) and Aqua (MYD04) satellites. The sensor resolution is 10km, imagery resolution is 2km, temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is June 22, 2012 - present.

Note: The algorithm is not applied over sunglint ocean regions or bright (desert) land regions, therefore gaps will occur at those locations. There is a complementary Deep Blue Algorithm for bright land retrievals.
