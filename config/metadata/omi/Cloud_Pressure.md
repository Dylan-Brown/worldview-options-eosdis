# OMI Cloud Pressure  

This is a gridded Level-2 OMI/Aura Cloud Pressure and Fraction, Raman Scattering Algorithm (OMCLDRR) daily composite image of CloudPressureO3. 

OMCLDRR retrieves effective cloud pressures from an amount of filling in of Fraunhofer lines caused by rotational Raman scattering in the atmosphere. OMCLDRR cloud pressure is “effective,” meaning that the cloud pressure may not represent the true physical cloud-top pressure (especially in the case of multiple cloud layers). The Level 2 data is produced pole-to-pole sunlit portion of a single orbit that is 2600 km wide in the cross-track direction and consists of 60 ground pixels across the track. 

The image data is composed by gridding the available Level 2 data for a day into ¼ degree by ¼ degree grid. When pixels overlaps the mean path length is used to choose the best pixel. In addition all data is filtered for the row anomaly. Image data is provided in hPa.
